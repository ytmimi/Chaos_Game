### The Chaos Game
The Basic Rules:
	Take a regular polygon and a random point starting inside the polygon. Randomly select one vertex and move towards it. Changing the rate at which the random point approaches each vertex will change the look of the final image. Some polygon and rate combination's just end up generating noise, but others turn into spectacular works of art.  For inspiration, check out the following examples
```


A triangle, where the point moved 1/2 the distance to each randomly selected vertex

A pentagon, where the point moved 3/5 the distance to each randomly selected vertex

An Octagon, where the point moved 3/5 the distance to each randomly selected vertex
